# Live vs VOD inside a VPN Detection

Due to the variety, affordability and convenience of online video streaming, there are more subscribers than ever to video streaming platforms. Moreover, the decreased operation of non-essential businesses and increase in the number of people working from home in this past year has further compounded this effect. More people are streaming live lectures, sports, news, and video calls via the internet at home today than we have ever seen before. Internet Service Providers, such as Viasat, are tasked with optimizing  internet connections and tailoring their allocation of resources to fit each unique customerâ€™s needs. With this increase in internet activity, it would be especially beneficial for Viasat to understand what issues arise when customers stream various forms of vide - specifically live video or video on demand!
